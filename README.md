Bike_share_project folder contains all code, data, and a list of necessary requirments to run code. The goal of the project was to explore working with geospatial data and graph neural networks. Using several different machine learning regression algorithms I model the realtionship between points of interest in New York City and bike ride destinations for Citi Bikes.
